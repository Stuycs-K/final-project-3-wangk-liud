# CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler

## Show of Hands
Have you ever created a password with:
Your name?
Nickname?
Birthdate?
Pet name?

## Your password is vulnerable
Probably not to rockyou.txt, but a custom wordlist that hackers can tailor to you.

## How do I exploit this?
[CUPP](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp) is a tool that creates custom wordlists using personalized information.
